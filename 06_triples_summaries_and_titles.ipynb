              "\".  Personality is a complex field of study in psychology that encompasses multiple subdisciplines, such as clinical and experimental psychology, philosophy, engineering, and medicine. It is a mix of science and value-laden categories, as it is concerned with the promotion of health and wellness. When considering what a healthy personality might be, it is not just the absence of pathology, but rather the development of positive potential. Personality psychology is a wide-ranging course, with an emphasis on clinical theoreticians, such as psychoanalysts, depth psychologists, constructivists, humanists, existentialists, and phenomenologists. The last half of the course concentrates on two elements of personality theory; more modern elements such as psychometrics, which is an unpopular field of psychology due to the discovery of technical psychometric intelligence by engineers, and clinical psychologists' suggestion that running away from something one is afraid of can make it larger and faster. Additionally, scientists need to be able to generate hypotheses as well as test them. Clinical psychologists and psychiatrists are not necessarily scientists, but rather engineers, who use scientific knowledge to make things better. Doctors are not even trained to be scientists, and their work is informed by science, such as the US Army's psychometric testing for officers\""
